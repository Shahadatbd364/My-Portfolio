<p>I love to travel very much. I like to spend time in a quiet place away from the noise of cars and people. I like mountains very much. Not much went though. The sound of ocean waves and the flow of water makes me feel good. After completing my S.S.C examination, all of my friend planed to going somewhere to refresh our mind after long time. After that we decided to going to Napittachora at Mirsarai. We all climb two hills. It was too dangerous to climb the two high mountains. We finally saw the fountain.A dip in the spring water ended our fatigue</p>
